<h1>Introductionhei</h1>
<p> Jeg sriver noe her jeg!!Welcome to the Canvas site for the course Technology and Society for Programmers!
    Digital competence is a key factor in ensuring the employability of candidates in all professions vital to our society.
    This course will provide an overview of how technology affects our lives as individuals, its impact on our social structures, the way we work and how we in turn create, shape, or choose our technology. Social media, digital governance, and artificial intelligence are all examples of how technology has profoundly changed our everyday lives in the last few decades. An understanding of the benefits and limitations of technology is vital in any profession, regardless of field or specialty.</p>
<h1>Obligatory group assignments</h1>
<p>The obligatory group assignments, of which you need to pass 5 in total, are published together with the modules in Canvas, or in relation to the lectures—one each week. They will be published at the beginning of each week, allowing you to work on the obligatory assignments throughout the week and finish up in the labs on Fridays. The students will work in groups on all of the obligatory assignments. You must be part of a group for each of the obligatory assignments— you cannot hand in obligatory assignments as an individual student—only group submissions. More information will be given in the orientation meeting.</p>
